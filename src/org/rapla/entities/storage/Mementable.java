 * <p>
 * <strong>Problem:</strong> Realization of an undo-feature when editing a object
 * The user edits only a clone of the original.
 * When the user aborts, the clone will be discarded. Upon committing the
 * changes, the original object should be set to the state of 
 * the clone and the clone should be discarded after that.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <strong>Memento-Pattern</strong> is used to get a clone of the original.
 * The newly created clone gets the state of the original:
 <pre>
 clone = original.deepClone()
 </pre>
 * To apply the changes to the original call 
 <pre>
 original.copy(clone)
 </pre>
